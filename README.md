## Description 
Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) and Finite ELement Analysis(FEA) is applied to simulate drones in harsh environmental conditions. This is to understand the airflow around drones as well as analyse internal stresses developed within the propellers of the drones. It is done with the aim of conducting virtual tests before physical testing. 

## Essential Knowledge Required

#### Pre-Processing 
* Geometry used in simulations are prepared by removing any unwanted material/holes/edges  
* Depending on scenario, boundary conditions and initial conditions are defined 
* Domain is discretized, mesh independence study to be conducted

#### Processing 
* Solvers are selected based on simulation requirements 
* Turbulence Models are selected based on simulation requirement--> typically k-epsilon
* Select Time Step using Courant-Freidrichs-Lewy(CFL) criterion(for transient simulations) 
* Monitor values of residuals and variables of interest 

#### Post-Processing 
* Observe velocity distribution by using **Paraview** 
* Obtain forces and torques acting on drones from simulation
* Validate results by using research papers to compare  

#### Next Steps 
1. Obtain moment of inertia of drone about each global axia(x, y and z) 
2. Use angular kinematics equations to calculate the angular acceleration drone experiences due to the torque. 
3. Calculate degrees of rotation about each axis, Î¸, using angular acceleration 
4. Rotate the drone accordingly and repeat the same steps for the simulations using the new orientation

### Workflow of FEA Simulations 
Workflow of FEA Simulations is similar to that of CFD's. 

#### Pre-Processing 
* Prepare geometry by simplifying 3d model i.e. remove unwanted components, holes, small edges 
* Assign materials to different parts of the model (different materials have different **Yield Strengths**) 
* Define constraints on model to control degree of freedom(Translation & Rotation) of components 
* Define structural loads on model 
* Discretize domain using FEM

#### Processing 
* Run the simulation, unlike CFD, FEA does not contain different solvers. Depending on softwarees used, different studies i.e. static stress analysis, modal analysis or transient analysis will have different solutions

#### Post-Processing
* Observe safety factor of model and ensure it is > 1.5 
* Observe areas of stress concentration and conclude why 
* Research and validate using results from research papers

## Upcoming Tasks
* Complete Mesh independence study for Coaxial drone (either automatically by writing a script or manually refining mesh)
* Complete Source codes for Steady State CFD simulations of Coaxial Drone 
* Complete Source code for Stress and Modal Analysis of Coaxial Drone
